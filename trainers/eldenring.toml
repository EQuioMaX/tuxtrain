# NOTICE: DO NOT RUN THIS WITH EAC ENABLED.
#
# TuxTrain is generic and it doesn't care what you are doing, therefor
# it does NOT care about something like EAC. I've not yet heard anyone
# neither try nor getting banned for unlocking their FPS, but I don't
# think you want to be the first either. It is also unfair when others
# are forced to play at 60 FPS.
#
# The regions in this trainer are fully tightened, I am not entirely sure
# if they are the same for different versions/releases of Elden Ring.
#
# If tuxtrain cannot find the pattern, please create an issue!
# See below for how to find the correct region for your version:
#
# The interesting maps (based on /proc/pid/maps) should look like below.
# Convert the addresses (e.g. 140000000-140001000 for [start, end]) to
# decimal and try it as region. Or remove the region entirely to search
# the entire process memory (this may take some time), tuxtrain will then
# output the correct region once found.
